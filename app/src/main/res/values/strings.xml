    <string name="asymmetry">Most malignant skin lesions are asymmetrical. If you draw a line through the middle of the lesion, the two halves don’t match, so it looks different from a round to oval and symmetrical common mole.</string>
    <string name="border">Malignant skin lesions borders tend to be uneven and may have scalloped or notched edges, while common moles tend to have smoother, more even borders.</string>
    <string name="color">Multiple colors are a warning sign. While benign moles are usually a single shade of brown, malignant skin lesions may have different shades of brown, tan or black. As it grows, the colors red, white or blue may also appear.</string>
    <string name="diameter">While it’s ideal to detect a malignant skin lesion when it is small, it’s a warning sign if a lesion is the size of a pencil eraser (about 6 mm, or ¼ inch in diameter) or larger.</string>
    <string name="evolving">Any change in size, shape, color or elevation of a spot on your skin, or any new symptom in it, such as bleeding, itching or crusting, may be a warning sign of malignant skin lesions.</string>
